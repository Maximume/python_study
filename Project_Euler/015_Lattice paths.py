# Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
# How many such routes are there through a 20Ã—20 grid?

# 1. it's familiar question, pathfinding, number of cases
# 2. init list with fill with 1
# 3. cases to (x,y) is sum of cases to (x-1,y) and cases to (x,y-1)
# 4. 20x20 grid has 21x21 points each axis
