# If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

# For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

# 1. thus right alngle triangle, a^2 + b^2 = c^2
# 2. only combinations are need, let's assume a < b < c
# 3. so, a is less than p/3, b is less than p/2
# 4. if a , b and p is given, c = p - a - b
